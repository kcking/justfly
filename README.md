# Just Fly

Simple and ergonomic flying for Satisfactory.

# Controls

- Double-tap `space` to toggle flying
- Tap `shift` to toggle fast-flying
- Hold `shift` to start super-fast-flying (tap again to go back to fast-flying)
- `wasd` fly
- `space` fly up, `c` fly down
- Double-tap `c` to toggle between
  - flying the direction you look (default)
  - locking your vertical position and only flying in a flat plane

If you configured different values for movement in the controls menu, JustFly will use those instead.

# About

This mod is a combination of my favorite parts of all of the different mods that enable flying (plus the toggle-sprint feature in the vanilla game that is saving all of our pinky fingers!)

# Known Issues

Currently does not work in multiplayer (working on it, reach out if you'd like to help!)

# Support

You can reach me as kinetic#9746 on the [Satisfactory Modding discord](https://bit.ly/SatisfactoryModding).
